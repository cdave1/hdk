Toolkit is the application that provides access to the HDK. It is 
designed to allow content creation for game engines built on top
of the HDK. It is a cross-platform, project-based editor
designed specifically for managing all Hackdirt projects.

Development Plan:

Version 1 will simply replicate the original 2.5d hackdirt level
editor, using all the original code from the earlier version of the
editor. Currently there is not time available to "start from scratch"
with the hdk as it were. JohnC has that luxury; I do not.

Version #1 will have an updated user interface (using QT), with two
additions:
- a top level application interface for managing projects (content, etc).
- a content browser showing textures, sounds, scripts, and interface
elements. The content browser will simply use a database for data
storage.

Version 2: extend the level editor to a full 3D editor. Add ragdoll
maker, mesh loader, pvrtc textures, interface scene editor.
